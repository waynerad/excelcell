Program for converting row numbers to column names using letters. So I ran into this problem where a friend of mine gave me a Excel spreadsheet that OpenOffice couldn't handle because it's limited to 1,024 columns (stops at AMJ). But it can handle over 1 million rows, so by flipping the rows and columns, I was able to open it. But, this presented a new problem: when they talked about a column (say column CU), what row was that in my spreadsheet? When I was looking at a row (row 756), what was the column designation in their spreadsheet, in Excel which didn't have the 1,024-column limit? A quick glance reveals that the column letters ("AMJ" etc) are not simply numbers in a base-26 number system (if that was the case, any number of "A"s would still represent 0 -- significantly, the blank space in front of the letters is not equivalent to 0s). I was able to work out conversions back and fourth between this bizarre "number" system and regular numbers using recursion.
